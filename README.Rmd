## NocMigR package
___

This package is in a *very* preliminary state and provides some workflows for processing large sound files (e.g., `NocMig`, `NFC`, `AudioMoth`), with a main emphasis on automatising the detection of events (i.e., extracting calls with time-stamps) that can be easily reviewed in [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/).

**All major computation steps are carried out by sophisticated libraries called in the background. Including:**


* **R packages**
* [bioacoustics](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bioacoustics)
* [tuneR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tuneR)
* [seewave](https://cran.r-project.org/package=seewave)
* [Warbler](https://cran.r-project.org/package=warbleR)

* **python packages**
* [audioop](https://docs.python.org/3/library/audioop.html)
* [pydub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub)

To install the package, use ...

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("mottensmann/NocMigR")
```

## Examples and documentation of main functions
___

Load the package once installed ...

```{r}
library(NocMigR)
```

### Load example audio

The package contains an example file captured using an [AudioMoth](https://www.openacousticdevices.info/) recorder. To reduce file size, a segment of five minutes was downsampled to 44.1 kHz and saved as 128 kbps mp3 file. In addition to a lot of noise there is short segment of interest (scale call of a Eurasian Pygmy Owl *Glaucidium passerinum*).

```{r, results='hide'}
## get path to test_audio.mp3
path <- system.file("extdata", "20211220_064253.mp3", package = "NocMigR")
## create temp folder
dir.create("example")
## copy to test_folder
file.copy(path, "example")
## convert to wav
bioacoustics::mp3_to_wav("example/20211220_064253.mp3", delete = T)
```

Plot spectro to see there is a lot of noise and a few spikes reflecting actual signals ...

```{r}
## read audio
audio <- tuneR::readWave("example/20211220_064253.wav")
## plot spectrum
bioacoustics::spectro(audio, FFT_size = 2048, flim = c(0, 5000))
```


### 1.) `rename_recording`

Naming files using a string that combines the recording date and starting time (`YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`) is convenient for archiving and analysing audio files (e.g, default of [AudioMoth](https://www.openacousticdevices.info/)). Some (most?) of the popular field recorders (e.g., Olympus LS, Tascam DR or Sony PCM) use different, rather uninformative naming schemes (date and number at best), but the relevant information to construct a proper date_time string is embedded in the meta data of the recording (accessible using `file.info()`, but requires correct settings of the internal clock!). For instance, long recording sessions using an Olympus LS-3 will create multiple files, all of which share the same creation and modification times (with respect to the first recording). By contrast, the Sony PCM-D100 saves files individuals (i.e, all have  unique ctimes and mtimes). Presets to rename files are available for both types described here.

```{r}
## only simulate output as file is already labelled
rename_recording(path = "example",
                 format = "wav",
                 recorder = "Sony PCM-D100",
                 simulate = T)
```

### 2.) `split_wave`: Divide long recordings 

This function allows to split long audio recordings into smaller chunks for processing with `bioacoustics::threshold_detection`. To keep the time information, files are written with the corresponding starting time. *The task is performed using a python script queried using [reticulate](https://cran.r-project.org/package=reticulate) 


```{r}
## split in segments
split_wave(file = "20211220_064253.wav", # which file
           path = "example", # where to find it
           segment = 30, # cut in 30 sec segments
           downsample = 32000) # resample at 32000

## show files
list.files("example/split/")
## delete folder
unlink("example/split", recursive = TRUE)
```
### 3.) `find events`: Identify signals of interest

This functions is a wrapper to `bioacoustics::threshold_detection()` aiming at extracting calls based on the signal to noise ratio and some target-specific assumptions about approximate call frequencies and durations. Check `?bioacoustics::threshold_detection()` for details. **Note, only some of the parameters that are defined in `bioacoustics::threshold_detection()` are used right know**. *For long recordings (i.e, several hours) it makes sense to run on segments as created before to avoid memory issues. Here we use the demo sound file as it is*

```{r}
## run detection threshold algorithm
TD <- find_events(wav.file = "example/20211220_064253.wav",
                  threshold = 8, # Signal-to-noise ratio in db
                  min_dur = 20, # min length in ms
                  max_dur = 300, # max length in ms
                  LPF = 5000, # low-pass filter at 500 Hz
                  HPF = 1000) # high-pass filter at 4 kHz

## Review events 
head(TD$data$event_data[,c("filename", "starting_time", "duration", "freq_max_amp")])

## display spectrogram based on approximate location of first six events
audio <- tuneR::readWave("example/20211220_064253.wav",
                         from = 46,
                         to = 50,
                         units = "seconds")
bioacoustics::spectro(audio, FFT_size = 2048, flim = c(0, 5000))
```

In addition to the output shown above, a file with labels for reviewing events in `Audacity` is created (wrapping `seewave::write.audacity()`).

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', dpi=300, out.width = "900px", fig.cap="Screenshot: Audacity raw labels"}
knitr::include_graphics("inst/extdata/screenshot_1.PNG")
```


### 4.) `extract_events`: Subset original recording file

Refines the output of `find_events` by first adding a buffer (default 1 second on both sides of the event) and subsequently merging overlapping selections to make the output more pretty. Additionally, allows to filter based on expected frequencies (i.e., checks maximum amplitude frequency is within the frequency band defined by `HPF:LPF`)

```{r}
## extract events based on object TD
df <- extract_events(threshold_detection = TD, 
                     path = "example",
                     format = "wav",
                     LPF = 4000,
                     HPF = 1000,
                     buffer = 1)
```
Display refined events ...

```{r}
## display spectrogram based on first six events
audio <- tuneR::readWave("example/20211220_064253.wav", 
                         from = df$from,
                         to = df$to,
                         units = "seconds")
bioacoustics::spectro(audio, FFT_size = 2048, flim = c(0, 5000))
```

Output reviewed in `Audacity` (note that events were grouped to one).


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', dpi=300, out.width = "900px",  fig.cap="Screenshot: Audacity refined label"}
knitr::include_graphics("inst/extdata/screenshot_2.PNG")
```

### 5.) `batch_process`: Execute several algorithms in batch mode 

Run all above steps in one go and for all files within a folder

```{r}
batch_process(
  path = "example",
  format = "wav",
  segment = NULL,
  downsample = NULL,
  SNR = 8,
  target = data.frame(min_dur = 20, # min length in ms
                      max_dur = 300, # max length in ms
                      LPF = 5000, # low-pass filter at 500 Hz
                      HPF = 1000),
  rename = FALSE)
```
