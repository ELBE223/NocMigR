  path,
  LPF = NULL,
  HPF = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{threshold_detection}{either class threshold_detection or path to audacity marks}

\item{buffer}{buffer in seconds added to before and after the event}

\item{format}{format of sound files. Either WAV (default) or mp3}

\item{path}{where to look up the sound file}

\item{LPF}{integer. Low-Pass Filter (Hz). Frequencies above the cutoff are greatly attenuated.
Default is set internally at the Nyquist frequency of the recording.}
